# STOCK_PRICE_PREDICTION

Stock price prediction using Quandl involves a structured approach to forecast future stock prices using historical data and financial indicators. First, you access Quandl to retrieve historical stock prices and relevant financial data by registering and obtaining an API key. The collected data is then cleaned to handle missing values and normalized for consistency. Feature engineering is applied to create new insights, such as moving averages and technical indicators. Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize trends and perform statistical analysis to identify influential features. Appropriate machine learning models like linear regression or neural networks are selected, trained on the data, and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error. The trained model is used to make future stock price predictions, and its effectiveness is assessed by comparing predictions with actual prices. Finally, the model is deployed for real-time forecasting, with continuous monitoring and updates to maintain accuracy and relevance. This comprehensive process using Quandl enables informed investment decisions based on data-driven insights.
